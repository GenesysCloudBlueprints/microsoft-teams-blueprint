This Genesys Cloud Developer Blueprint explains how to set up Genesys Cloud and Microsoft 365 for agents to schedule a meeting with customers using Microsoft Teams. The agents can now directly schedule a Microsoft Teams meeting from Genesys Cloud. Genesys Cloud automatically sends an SMS message with the meeting URL to the customer and also opens the Microsoft Teams for the agent. The call is inbound or outbound as long it is in a queue. 
The meeting scheduling solution from an agentâ€™s point of view is shown in the illustration.

To enable an agent to use Microsoft Teams meeting from Genesys Cloud, the operation spans multiple platforms at the system level. The public APIs offered by both Genesys Cloud and Microsoft Graph provide this interoperability. The API interaction between Genesys Cloud and Microsoft 365 is shown in the illustration.

## Solution components
* **Genesys Cloud** - A suite of Genesys cloud services for enterprise-grade communications, collaboration, and contact center management. Contact center agents use the Genesys Cloud user interface.
* **Genesys Cloud API** - A set of RESTful APIs that enables you to extend and customize your Genesys Cloud environment. The Genesys Cloud API for agentless SMS notification sends the meeting information to the caller.
* **Amazon Web Services** - Amazon Web Services (AWS), a cloud computing platform that provides a variety of cloud services such as computing power, database storage, and content delivery. AWS hosts Genesys Cloud.
* **Microsoft 365** - An integrated, cloud suite of productivity apps. This solution uses one of the apps, namely Microsoft Teams to schedule meetings.
* **Microsoft Teams** - A meeting and communication app. Microsoft Teams is the app that hosts the meeting for our solution.
* **Microsoft Graph** - A unified API endpoint that enables developers to integrate services and devices with Microsoft products. This solution uses the API endpoint to create a meeting in Microsoft Teams.
* **Microsoft Azure** - A cloud computing platform that provides a variety of cloud services for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications through Microsoft-managed data centers. Microsoft Azure hosts Microsoft 365.
