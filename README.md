This Genesys Blueprint is a guide to setting up Genesys Cloud and Microsoft 365 to provide a meeting scheduling solution for agents using Genesys Cloud. Combining the two systems allows an agent to click a button in Genesys Cloud and schedule a Microsoft Teams online meeting with their caller. The agent does not need to leave Genesys Cloud to schedule the meeting with the Microsoft application. Genesys Cloud automatically sends an SMS message with the meeting URL to the customer's phone, and Genesys Cloud also opens the Microsoft Teams meeting for the agent. The call can be inbound or outbound, as long as it is in a queue. The figure below illustrates the agent's view of the meeting scheduling solution.
